Purpose of the IMiC Database: The IMiC Database is an essential tool for researchers to access information related to human milk composition and underlying data for research and educational purposes.
It is designed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and advance scientific understanding in human milk composition and related research.

Stored Data: The database is designed to accommodate a wide range of data sources and analytes.
It currently includes data collected from various study sites in multiple countries.
The available types of human milk data include but are not limited to: Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO), Targeted Metabolomics, Untargeted Metabolomics, Macronutrients, Micronutrients, Microbiome, Targeted Bioactive Proteins and Untargeted Proteomics.
In addition to human milk data underlying data is available for each associated study.
The intention of this database is to be scalable, with the capability to incorporate additional studies and their associated data seamlessly, allowing for future expansion and integration of diverse research sources.

Underlying data: Underlying data encompasses all primary data, associated metadata, and any additional relevant data necessary to understand, assess, and replicate reported study findings in totality.
