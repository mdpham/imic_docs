# How to use the portal

## Studies
Researchers can create a new study by providing details such as study name, description, and associated metadata. They can define the scope, objectives, and parameters of the study, laying the foundation for subsequent data collection and analysis.

## Datasets
Researchers upload and store their raw datasets. Raw datasets contain the original, unprocessed data collected during the study. Researchers can associate these datasets with specific timepoints, sites, and ontologies, providing the foundation for further data transformation and harmonization.
Datasets are graphs that contain the harmonized KI data. Researchers can explore, query, and analyze these datasets, which provide a comprehensive and standardized representation of the study's data. The curated datasets capture changes over time and serve as a reliable and trusted source for research findings.

## Explore
Researchers are able to explore the collection of all datasets in order to select data variables of interest across cohorts

## Exports
Researchers can create customized exports of specific data variables from the curated datasets. They can select variables of interest and export them in a desired format for further analysis or sharing with collaborators. Data variable exports enable researchers to focus on specific aspects of the data that align with their research objectives.

## Metadata
Researchers can manage timepoints and sites associated with their study in this section. They can define specific time intervals or events that mark important milestones within the study. Additionally, they can input geographic site information, such as locations where data was collected or specific research sites.
By effectively managing timepoints and sites, researchers can organize and analyze their data based on temporal and spatial dimensions, facilitating meaningful insights and observations throughout the course of the study.
Including additional sites not already listed will require contacting portal administrators.
Study ontologies section enables researchers to define and manage the ontologies used in their study. Ontologies provide a standardized vocabulary for describing and categorizing data. Researchers can create and associate ontologies with their study to ensure consistent and meaningful annotation of collected data.

## Administration
Administrators of the portal must approve datasets before they are made available to users as well as permissions for users to upload.

# Terms of Service
By using or accessing the IMiC Database, you agree to these Terms of Use ("Terms")
These Terms constitute a legal agreement between you and the International Milk Composition (IMiC) Consortium
If you do not agree to all of these Terms, you cannot use the IMiC Database and cannot access or download data from it.
Please contact <imic@umanitoba.ca> for alternative methods to access the data.
If you use the IMiC Database, your access and use of the data are subject to the following Terms.

Purpose of the IMiC Database: The IMiC Database is an essential tool for researchers to access information related to human milk composition and underlying data for research and educational purposes.
It is designed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and advance scientific understanding in human milk composition and related research.

Stored Data: The database is designed to accommodate a wide range of data sources and analytes.
It currently includes data collected from various study sites in multiple countries.
The available types of human milk data include but are not limited to: Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO), Targeted Metabolomics, Untargeted Metabolomics, Macronutrients, Micronutrients, Microbiome, Targeted Bioactive Proteins and Untargeted Proteomics.
In addition to human milk data underlying data is available for each associated study.
The intention of this database is to be scalable, with the capability to incorporate additional studies and their associated data seamlessly, allowing for future expansion and integration of diverse research sources.

Underlying data: Underlying data encompasses all primary data, associated metadata, and any additional relevant data necessary to understand, assess, and replicate reported study findings in totality.
Access to the data stored in the IMiC database allows for barrier-free and timely access to data, reassessment of current data interpretations and analysis, ability to verify reproduce and reuse data in new ways, data provenance and preservation.
We do not share any data that is ethically unsound or legally encumbered.

Data Permissions: Access to the data within the IMiC Database is granted on a case-by-case basis, dependent on the roles and responsibilities of authorized individuals.

The specific access levels are as follows:

- Data Uploader Access: Allows individuals to upload data.
- Data Download Access: Permits users to download data.
- Data Analyst Access: Individuals in this role have the privilege to access and analyze data but do not have upload capabilities.
- Reviewer Access: Reviewers can access data for quality checks, validation, and review purposes.
- Guest Access: Users with limited access to view specific data without download or upload capabilities.
- Data Approver Access: This role allows individuals to approve or disapprove data submissions.
- Data Auditor Access: Auditors are responsible for inspecting data for accuracy, compliance, and quality.
- Report Generation Access: This role focuses on generating reports based on available data without the need for direct data management.
